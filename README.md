# HttpStub

Ad-hoc local servers to test your HTTP client code.

Actual web servers,  
testing the full stack.  
Assert on the request,  
and send a response back.  

It's based on hyper,  
because it's the best.  
And asserts with regex,  
instead of just text.  

The code is quite simple,  
and easy to digest,  
if you want to contribute,  
send your pull request.
